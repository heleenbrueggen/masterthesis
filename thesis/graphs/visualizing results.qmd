## Bias 

### Bias random intercept and residual variance

::: {.column-screen-left}
#### New graph

::: {.column-screen-left}
#### Old graph
![](old_graphs/bias2.png)
:::
#### Conclusion 

- `pmm` and `rbart` perform worse in the new graphs
- `stan4bart` seems to performa slightly better overall 
- __no__ substantial differences

### Bias cross-level interactions 
#### New graph
::: {.column-screen-left}

#### Old graph
::: {.column-screen-left}
![](old_graphs/biascrosslevel.png)
:::
#### Conclusion

- __no__ substantial differences
- `stan4bart` seems to perform better when data is MAR in new graphs
- methods perform better for $\gamma_{32}$
- `pmm`, `bart`, and `rbart` slightly better performance 
- `stan4bart` has better and worse performance

### Bias random intercept 
#### New graph
::: {.column-screen-left}

#### Old graph
::: {.column-screen-left}
![](old_graphs/biasintercept.png)
:::
#### Conclusion

- `rbart` way worse in new graph under MAR 
- true analyses more accurate
- `stan4bart` consistant overestimation under MAR 
- methods perform similar under MCAR 

### Bias level 1 effects 
#### New graph
::: {.column-screen-left}

#### Old graph
::: {.column-screen-left}
![](old_graphs/biaslevel1.png)
:::
#### Conclusion

- `rbart` REALLY bad 
- `stan4bart` worse in new graphs
- `pmm` now worse under MAR 
- `bart` better in new graphs with larger sample size
- `2l.pmm` worse is new graphs

### Bias level 2 effects 
#### New graph
::: {.column-screen-left}
![](biaslevel2.png)
:::
#### Old graph
::: {.column-screen-left}
![](old_graphs/biaslevel2.png)
:::
#### Conclusion

- true analyses more accurate
- `stan4bart` now better with larger sample size 
- 2l.pmm better 
- __no__ substantial differences

### Bias random slopes 
#### New graph
::: {.column-screen-left}

:::
#### Old graph
::: {.column-screen-left}
![](old_graphs/biasrandom.png)
:::
#### Conclusion

- true analyses more accurate
- `stan4bart` and `2l.pmm` $\upsilon_2$ way worse in new graphs
- `bart` and `pmm` still worst in both graphs and then `rbart`
