# MSc Thesis: Multilevel Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations through Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
 
## Design
This study is a simulation study to compare the performance of different imputation methods in the context of multilevel data. The imputation methods that are compared are: single level predictive mean matching (PMM); multilevel PMM; single level Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART); multilevel BART with random intercepts; and multilevel BART with random intercepts, random slopes, and cross-level interactions.

## Data Generation
This study uses simulated data. The data is generated with the script `Scripts\Simulation data.R`
