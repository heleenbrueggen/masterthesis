  abstract = {Missing covariate data commonly occur in epidemiological and clinical research, and are often dealt with using multiple imputation. Imputation of partially observed covariates is complicated if the substantive model is non-linear (e.g. Cox proportional hazards model), or contains non-linear (e.g. squared) or interaction terms, and standard software implementations of multiple imputation may impute covariates from models that are incompatible with such substantive models. We show how imputation by fully conditional specification, a popular approach for performing multiple imputation, can be modified so that covariates are imputed from models which are compatible with the substantive model. We investigate through simulation the performance of this proposal, and compare it with existing approaches. Simulation results suggest our proposal gives consistent estimates for a range of common substantive models, including models which contain non-linear covariate effects or interactions, provided data are missing at random and the assumed imputation models are correctly specified and mutually compatible. Stata software implementing the approach is freely available.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Multiple imputation (MI) is an established technique for handling missing data in observational studies. Joint modelling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS) are commonly used methods for imputing multilevel data. However, MI methods for multilevel ordinal outcome variables have not been well studied, especially when cluster size is informative on the outcome. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare different MI strategies for dealing with multilevel ordinal outcomes when informative cluster size (ICS) exists.                                         Methods               We conducted comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to compare the performance of five strategies: complete case analysis (CCA), FCS, FCS+CS (including cluster size (CS) in the imputation model), JM, and JM+CS under various scenarios. We evaluated their performance using a proportional odds logistic regression model estimated with cluster weighted generalized estimating equations (CWGEE).                                         Results               The simulation results showed that including CS in the imputation model can significantly improve estimation accuracy when ICS exists. FCS provided more accurate and robust estimation than JM, followed by CCA for multilevel ordinal outcomes. We further applied these strategies to a real dental study to assess the association between metabolic syndrome and clinical attachment loss scores. The results based on FCS + CS indicated that the power of the analysis would increase after carrying out the appropriate MI strategy.                                         Conclusions               MI is an effective tool to increase the accuracy and power of the downstream statistical analysis for missing ordinal outcomes. FCS slightly outperforms JM when imputing multilevel ordinal outcomes. When there is plausible ICS, we recommend including CS in the imputation phase.},

  abstract = {A wide range of machine-learning-based approaches have been developed in the past decade, increasing our ability to accurately model nonlinear and nonadditive response surfaces. This has improved performance for inferential tasks such as estimating average treatment effects in situations where standard parametric models may not fit the data well. These methods have also shown promise for the related task of identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. However, the estimation of both overall and heterogeneous treatment effects can be hampered when data are structured within groups if we fail to correctly model the dependence between observations. Most machine learning methods do not readily accommodate such structure. This paper introduces a new algorithm, stan4bart, that combines the flexibility of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for fitting nonlinear response surfaces with the computational and statistical efficiencies of using Stan for the parametric components of the model. We demonstrate how stan4bart can be used to estimate average, subgroup, and individual-level treatment effects with stronger performance than other flexible approaches that ignore the multilevel structure of the data as well as multilevel approaches that have strict parametric forms.},

The estimation of these models can be difficult when the underlying variables contain missing data. Although several methods for handling missing data such as multiple imputation (MI) can be used with multilevel data, conventional methods for multilevel MI often do not properly take the nonlinear associations between the variables into account. In the present paper, we propose a sequential modeling approach based on Bayesian estimation techniques that can be used to handle missing data in a variety of multilevel models that involve nonlinear effects. The main idea of this approach is to decompose the joint distribution of the data into several parts that correspond to the outcome and explanatory variables in the intended analysis, thus generating imputations in a manner that is compatible with the substantive analysis model. In three simulation studies, we evaluate the sequential modeling approach and compare it with conventional as well as other substantive-model-compatible approaches to multilevel MI. We implemented the sequential modeling approach in the R package  and provide a worked example to illustrate its application.},

A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some ``truth'' (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data.

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (``ADEMP''); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume~34 of               Statistics in Medicine               , which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to perform simulation studies to evaluate the properties of imputation methods. In part, this may be due to different aims between fields and studies. For example, when evaluating imputation techniques aimed at prediction, different aims may be formulated than when statistical inference is of interest. The lack of consensus may also stem from different personal preferences or scientific backgrounds. All in all, the lack of common ground in evaluating imputation methodology may lead to suboptimal use in practice. In this paper, we propose a move toward a standardized evaluation of imputation methodology. To demonstrate the need for standardization, we highlight a set of possible pitfalls that bring forth a chain of potential problems in the objective assessment of the performance of imputation routines. Additionally, we suggest a course of action for simulating and evaluating missing data problems. Our suggested course of action is by no means meant to serve as a complete cookbook, but rather meant to incite critical thinking and a move to objective and fair evaluations of imputation methodology. We invite the readers of this paper to contribute to the suggested course of~action.},

The method maintains the flexibility and the ability of modeling complex patterns within the data, typical of tree-based ensemble methods, and it can handle both continuous and discrete covariates. At the same time, GMERF takes into account the nested structure of hierarchical data, modeling the dependence structure that exists at the highest level of the hierarchy and allowing statistical inference on this structure. In the case study, we apply GMERF to Higher Education data to analyze the university student dropout phenomenon. We predict engineering student dropout probability by means of student-level information and considering the degree program students are enrolled in as grouping factor.},

Methods               Here we thoroughly investigate a SMC-MI strategy based on joint modeling of the covariates of the analysis model. We provide code to apply the proposed strategy and we perform an extensive simulation work to test it in various circumstances.               We explore the impact on the results of various factors, including whether the missing data are at the individual or cluster level, whether there are non-linearities and whether the imputation model is correctly specified. Finally, we apply the imputation methods to the motivating example data.                                         Results               SMC-JM appears to be superior to standard JM imputation, particularly in presence of large variation in random slopes, non-linearities, and interactions. Results seem to be robust to slight mis-specification of the imputation model for the covariates. When imputing level 2 data, enough clusters have to be observed in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the level 2 parameters.

Previously proposed methods to impute incomplete multilevel data handle either systematically or sporadically missing data, but frequently both patterns are observed. We describe a new multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) algorithm for multilevel data with arbitrary patterns of systematically and sporadically missing variables. The algorithm is described for multilevel normal data but can easily be extended for other variable types. We first propose two methods for imputing a single incomplete variable: an extension of an existing method and a new two-stage method which conveniently allows for heteroscedastic data. We then discuss the difficulties of imputing missing values in several variables in multilevel data using MICE, and show that even the simplest joint multilevel model implies conditional models which involve cluster means and heteroscedasticity. However, a simulation study finds that the proposed methods can be successfully combined in a multilevel MICE procedure, even when cluster means are not included in the imputation models.},

This comparison is complex because the composition of patients treated by each provider may differ. Similar issues arise when simultaneously comparing the adverse effects of interventions using non-randomized data. To simultaneously estimate the effects of multiple providers/interventions we propose procedures that explicitly impute the set of potential outcomes for each subject. The procedures are based on different specifications of the generalized additive models (GAM) and the Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). We compare the performance of the proposed procedures to previously proposed matching and weighting procedures using an extensive simulation study for continuous outcomes. Our simulations show that when the distributions of the covariates across treatment groups have adequate overlap, the multiple imputation procedures based on separate BART or GAM models in each treatment group are generally superior to weighting based methods and have similar and sometimes better performance than matching on the logit of the generalized propensity score. Another advantage of these multiple imputation procedures is the ability to provide point and interval estimates to a wide range of causal effect estimands. We apply the proposed procedures to comparing multiple nursing homes in Massachusetts for readmission outcomes. The proposed approach can be applied to other causal effects applications with multiple treatments.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.             Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.

  abstract = {Abstract                            In cluster randomized trials, intact social units such as schools, worksites or medical practices {\textendash} rather than individuals themselves {\textendash} are randomly allocated to intervention and control conditions, while the outcomes of interest are then observed on individuals within each cluster. Such trials are becoming increasingly common in the fields of health promotion and health services research. Attrition is a common occurrence in randomized trials, and a standard approach for dealing with the resulting missing values is imputation. We consider imputation strategies for missing continuous outcomes, focusing on trials with a completely randomized design in which fixed cohorts from each cluster are enrolled prior to random assignment. We compare five different imputation strategies with respect to Type I and Type II error rates of the adjusted two-sample               t               -test for the intervention effect. Cluster mean imputation is compared with multiple imputation, using either within-cluster data or data pooled across clusters in each intervention group. In the case of pooling across clusters, we distinguish between standard multiple imputation procedures which do not account for intracluster correlation and a specialized procedure which does account for intracluster correlation but is not yet available in standard statistical software packages. A simulation study is used to evaluate the influence of cluster size, number of clusters, degree of intracluster correlation, and variability among cluster follow-up rates.                          We show that cluster mean imputation yields valid inferences and given its simplicity, may be an attractive option in some large community intervention trials which are subject to individual-level attrition only; however, it may yield less powerful inferences than alternative procedures which pool across clusters especially when the cluster sizes are small and cluster follow-up rates are highly variable. When pooling across clusters, the imputation procedure should generally take intracluster correlation into account to obtain valid inferences; however, as long as the intracluster correlation coefficient is small, we show that standard multiple imputation procedures may yield acceptable type I error rates; moreover, these procedures may yield more powerful inferences than a specialized procedure, especially when the number of available clusters is small. Within-cluster multiple imputation is shown to be the least powerful among the procedures considered. ({\textcopyright} 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  abstract = {The development of driverless vehicles has spurred the need to predict human driving behavior to facilitate interaction between driverless and human-driven vehicles. Predicting human driving movements can be challenging, and poor prediction models can lead to accidents between the driverless and human-driven vehicles. We used the vehicle speed obtained from a naturalistic driving dataset to predict whether a human-driven vehicle would stop before executing a left turn. In a preliminary analysis, we found that BART produced less variable and higher AUC values compared to a variety of other state-of-the-art binary predictor methods. However, BART assumes independent observations, but our dataset consists of multiple observations clustered by driver. Although methods extending BART to clustered or longitudinal data are available, they lack readily available software and can only be applied to clustered continuous outcomes. We extend BART to handle correlated binary observations by adding a random intercept and used a simulation study to determine bias, root mean squared error, 95\% coverage, and average length of 95\% credible interval in a correlated data setting. We then successfully implemented our random intercept BART model to our clustered dataset and found substantial improvements in prediction performance compared to BART and random intercept linear logistic regression.},

  abstract = {The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features, potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Responsive survey designs rely upon incoming data from the field data collection to optimize cost and quality tradeoffs. In order to make these decisions in real-time, survey managers rely upon monitoring tools that generate proxy indicators for cost and quality. There is a developing literature on proxy indicators for the risk of nonresponse bias. However, there is very little research on proxy indicators for costs and almost none aimed at predicting costs under alternative design strategies. Predictions of survey costs and proxy error indicators can be used to optimize survey designs in real time. Using data from the National Survey of Family Growth, we evaluate alternative modeling strategies aimed at predicting survey costs (specifically, interviewer hours). The models include multilevel regression (with random interviewer effects) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).},

  abstract = {We propose a simple yet powerful extension of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees which we name Hierarchical Embedded BART (HE-BART). The model allows for random effects to be included at the terminal node level of a set of regression trees, making HE-BART a non-parametric alternative to mixed effects models which avoids the need for the user to specify the structure of the random effects in the model, whilst maintaining the prediction and uncertainty calibration properties of standard BART. Using simulated and real-world examples, we demonstrate that this new extension yields superior predictions for many of the standard mixed effects models' example data sets, and yet still provides consistent estimates of the random effect variances. In a future version of this paper, we outline its use in larger, more advanced data sets and structures.},
