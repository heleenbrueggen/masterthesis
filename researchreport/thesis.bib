  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Multiple imputation (MI) is an established technique for handling missing data in observational studies. Joint modelling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS) are commonly used methods for imputing multilevel data. However, MI methods for multilevel ordinal outcome variables have not been well studied, especially when cluster size is informative on the outcome. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare different MI strategies for dealing with multilevel ordinal outcomes when informative cluster size (ICS) exists.                                         Methods               We conducted comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to compare the performance of five strategies: complete case analysis (CCA), FCS, FCS+CS (including cluster size (CS) in the imputation model), JM, and JM+CS under various scenarios. We evaluated their performance using a proportional odds logistic regression model estimated with cluster weighted generalized estimating equations (CWGEE).                                         Results               The simulation results showed that including CS in the imputation model can significantly improve estimation accuracy when ICS exists. FCS provided more accurate and robust estimation than JM, followed by CCA for multilevel ordinal outcomes. We further applied these strategies to a real dental study to assess the association between metabolic syndrome and clinical attachment loss scores. The results based on FCS + CS indicated that the power of the analysis would increase after carrying out the appropriate MI strategy.                                         Conclusions               MI is an effective tool to increase the accuracy and power of the downstream statistical analysis for missing ordinal outcomes. FCS slightly outperforms JM when imputing multilevel ordinal outcomes. When there is plausible ICS, we recommend including CS in the imputation phase.},

We show with theoretical arguments and computer simulations that (a) an FCS approach that uses latent cluster means is comparable to JM and (b) using manifest cluster means provides similar results except in relatively extreme cases with unbalanced data. We outline a computational procedure for including latent cluster means in an FCS approach using plausible values and provide an example using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment 2012 study.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation methods can generally be divided into two broad frameworks: joint model (JM) imputation and fully conditional specification (FCS) imputation. JM draws missing values simultaneously for all incomplete variables using a multivariate distribution, whereas FCS imputes variables one at a time from a series of univariate conditional distributions. In single-level multivariate normal data, these two approaches have been shown to be equivalent, but less is known about their similarities and differences with multilevel data. This study examined four multilevel multiple imputation approaches: JM approaches proposed by Schafer and Yucel and Asparouhov and Muth{\'e}n and FCS methods described by van Buuren and Carpenter and Kenward. Analytic work and computer simulations showed that Asparouhov and Muth{\'e}n and Carpenter and Kenward methods are most flexible, as they produce imputations that preserve distinct within- and between-cluster covariance structures. As such, these approaches are applicable to random intercept models that posit level-specific relations among variables (e.g., contextual effects analyses, multilevel structural equation models). In contrast, methods from Schafer and Yucel and van Buuren are more restrictive and impose implicit equality constraints on functions of the within- and between-cluster covariance matrices. The analytic work and simulations underscore the conclusion that researchers should not expect to obtain the same results from alternative imputation routines. Rather, it is important to choose an imputation method that partitions variation in a manner that is consistent with the analysis model of interest. A real data analysis example illustrates the various approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We propose a new statistical method, called generalized mixed-effects random forest (GMERF), that extends the use of random forest to the analysis of hierarchical data, for any type of response variable in the exponential family. The method maintains the flexibility and the ability of modeling complex patterns within the data, typical of tree-based ensemble methods, and it can handle both continuous and discrete covariates. At the same time, GMERF takes into account the nested structure of hierarchical data, modeling the dependence structure that exists at the highest level of the hierarchy and allowing statistical inference on this structure. In the case study, we apply GMERF to Higher Education data to analyze the university student dropout phenomenon. We predict engineering student dropout probability by means of student-level information and considering the degree program students are enrolled in as grouping factor.},

  abstract = {Background               Substantive model compatible multiple imputation (SMC-MI) is a relatively novel imputation method that is particularly useful when the analyst's model includes interactions, non-linearities, and/or partially observed random slope variables.                                         Methods               Here we thoroughly investigate a SMC-MI strategy based on joint modeling of the covariates of the analysis model. We provide code to apply the proposed strategy and we perform an extensive simulation work to test it in various circumstances.               We explore the impact on the results of various factors, including whether the missing data are at the individual or cluster level, whether there are non-linearities and whether the imputation model is correctly specified. Finally, we apply the imputation methods to the motivating example data.                                         Results               SMC-JM appears to be superior to standard JM imputation, particularly in presence of large variation in random slopes, non-linearities, and interactions. Results seem to be robust to slight mis-specification of the imputation model for the covariates. When imputing level 2 data, enough clusters have to be observed in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the level 2 parameters.                                         Conclusions               SMC-JM is preferable to standard JM imputation in presence of complexities in the analysis model of interest, such as non-linearities or random slopes.},

  abstract = {In multilevel settings such as individual participant data meta-analysis, a variable is `systematically missing' if it is wholly missing in some clusters and `sporadically missing' if it is partly missing in some clusters. Previously proposed methods to impute incomplete multilevel data handle either systematically or sporadically missing data, but frequently both patterns are observed. We describe a new multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) algorithm for multilevel data with arbitrary patterns of systematically and sporadically missing variables. The algorithm is described for multilevel normal data but can easily be extended for other variable types. We first propose two methods for imputing a single incomplete variable: an extension of an existing method and a new two-stage method which conveniently allows for heteroscedastic data. We then discuss the difficulties of imputing missing values in several variables in multilevel data using MICE, and show that even the simplest joint multilevel model implies conditional models which involve cluster means and heteroscedasticity. However, a simulation study finds that the proposed methods can be successfully combined in a multilevel MICE procedure, even when cluster means are not included in the imputation models.},

  abstract = {The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features, potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.},

In order to make these decisions in real-time, survey managers rely upon monitoring tools that generate proxy indicators for cost and quality. There is a developing literature on proxy indicators for the risk of nonresponse bias. However, there is very little research on proxy indicators for costs and almost none aimed at predicting costs under alternative design strategies. Predictions of survey costs and proxy error indicators can be used to optimize survey designs in real time. Using data from the National Survey of Family Growth, we evaluate alternative modeling strategies aimed at predicting survey costs (specifically, interviewer hours). The models include multilevel regression (with random interviewer effects) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).},
